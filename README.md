The app is minimal but fully functional. You can Add an Item. On adding an item, it goes to the To-Do section, and on checking the item as complete, it moves to the completed section and vice-versa. 
The Edit and Delete buttons help edit and delete individual tasks while a counter keeps track of total completed tasks.

Finally, The SAVE button saves your changes to localStorage so that you get back the changes on page refresh or returning to the page.
